# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
#
# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.
#
# See http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret for more details.

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# play.http.router = my.application.Routes
